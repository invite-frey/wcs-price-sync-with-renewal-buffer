# WCS Price Sync with Renewal Buffer

**Plugin Name:** WCS Price Sync with Renewal Buffer  
**Stable tag:** 1.0  
**Requires at least:** WordPress 5.5, WooCommerce 8.0, WooCommerce Subscriptions 5.0  
**Tested up to:** WordPress 6.7, WooCommerce 9.5, WooCommerce Subscriptions 6.8

**License:** GPLv2 or later  
**License URI:** https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html

Automatically syncs subscription line item prices to the current product price **only when safe** — i.e. only when there is still enough time before the next renewal (configurable buffer period).

Prevents price changes from applying after renewal reminder emails have already been sent (or are about to be sent), avoiding customer confusion and support tickets.

## Why this plugin?

WooCommerce Subscriptions does **not** automatically update existing subscription prices when you change a product's price.

Many store owners want existing subscriptions to gradually move to new pricing — but **not** if the renewal is imminent and a reminder has already gone out (or is about to).

This plugin adds that safety buffer logic.

## Features

- Adds a **"Price Update Buffer Days"** setting under **WooCommerce → Settings → Subscriptions**
- When you update & save a subscription product → automatically updates **active** subscriptions using that product
- Skips update if the next payment date is within the buffer window (e.g. 7 days)
- Respects your existing **renewal reminder timing** (set buffer = your reminder days)
- Includes a **bulk action** in Subscriptions list table: "Sync Prices (with Buffer)"
- Adds order note when price is updated
- Lightweight — no cron jobs, no extra tables
- Safe double-save prevention (transient lock)

## Installation

1. Download the plugin ZIP
2. In WordPress Admin → Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin
3. Activate the plugin
4. Go to **WooCommerce → Settings → Subscriptions**
5. Set **Price Update Buffer Days** to match your renewal reminder timing (e.g. `7` if reminders go out 7 days before renewal)

Done.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does it work with variable subscriptions?**  
Currently only simple subscription products are fully supported (pulls `$product->get_price()`). Variable support would require choosing which variation — PRs welcome.

**What happens if buffer is set to 0?**  
Price updates happen immediately on every product save (same as no buffer).

**Why isn't the price updating even when outside buffer?**  
Make sure:
- The product is marked as a **Simple** Subscription product
- The subscription is **active**
- The subscription contains that exact product ID
- You're editing and **saving** the product (not just changing price in quick edit)

**I want to force-update even inside buffer — can I?**  
Not currently. You can temporarily set buffer to 0, update products, then set it back (or use the bulk action carefully).
